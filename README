A replacement for CCLabelBMFont. Useful if you want:
 - Left, Center, and Right alignments for single and multi line labels
 - Auto word wrap for inserting line breaks intelligently based on given width

To use, download both CCLabelBMFont.h and CCLabelBMFont.m, and replace the 2 files under the cocos2d folder with the new modified files.

In your code, do:

CCLabelBMFont *label = [CCLabelBMFont
	labelWithString:@"My Label"
	fntFile:@"my-font-file.fnt"
	width:200
	alignment:CenterAlignment];

The included demo project has an sample .fnt file made using GlyphDesigner, and examples on how to use CCLabelBMFont.
